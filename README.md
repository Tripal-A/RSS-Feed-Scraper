Created a code that ran every 59 minutes on the Pythonanywhere enviornment. This code scraped 2 RSS feeds for keywords "Tableau" and "Zapier",
it took the title, summary, published date, and link and created a pandas dataframe that was then pushed into a MYsql database.

This information was then used to gather insights on what clients needed specifically when it came to tableau and zapier services. With that information a freelancer is able
to better position their skill set.
